# Efficient Text Analysis of Blogs: Clustering and Classification Techniques for Content Insights

## üìå Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a pivotal role in machine learning and data science, enabling the computational analysis of human language. With the explosion of user-generated content such as blogs and social media, extracting meaningful insights from large volumes of unstructured text has become increasingly important.

This project analyzes blog posts sourced from the **Blog Authorship Corpus**, which contains over **681,000 posts** from **19,320 authors**, totaling **140M+ words**. To manage computational complexity, a **subset of 10,000 posts** was selected.  
The key objective is to apply **clustering** and **classification** techniques to:
- Group similar blog posts.
- Predict demographic attributes (e.g., gender).
- Generate insights for content organization, recommendation, and analysis.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement and Justification
Unstructured blog text poses challenges for analysis and organization. This project addresses:
- How to cluster blog posts into meaningful groups.
- How to classify author demographics (gender) from text.  

The analysis supports applications in **content recommendation, topic modeling, and targeted insights**, helping improve the organization and usability of large-scale text data.

---

## ‚úÖ Assumptions and Scope
- Dataset is pre-cleaned (minimal noise, irrelevant content removed).
- Traditional clustering methods (KMeans, Affinity Propagation, Hierarchical) are applicable.
- Hierarchical clustering is useful for visualizing text group relationships.
- Scope: **Text clustering + gender classification** from blog content.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps:
- **Text normalization** (lowercasing, punctuation removal).
- **Tokenization** (splitting into words).
- **Stopword removal** (removing uninformative words).
- **Lemmatization** (reducing words to base form).

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Substantial variation in word usage and post lengths.  
- **Frequent words**: ‚Äútime‚Äù, ‚Äúone‚Äù, ‚Äúknow‚Äù, ‚Äúthink‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople‚Äù.  
- Word clouds provided early thematic insights.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Approach

### üîπ Classification Models (Gender Prediction)
| Model                   | Accuracy | AUC  |
|--------------------------|----------|------|
| Support Vector Machine   | **Best** | 0.89 |
| Logistic Regression      | 80.95%   | -    |
| Naive Bayes              | 80.75%   | -    |
| Ridge Classifier         | 81.20%   | -    |
| Random Forest            | 77.75%   | -    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors      | 60.35%   | -    |

- **SVM** achieved the best results, showing strong discrimination with AUC = 0.89.  
- Misclassifications mostly involved **female posts predicted as male**.

### üîπ Clustering Methods
- **KMeans**: Balanced, interpretable clusters with distinct keywords.
- **Affinity Propagation**: Produced variable cluster sizes, sometimes unstable.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Effective for **visualizing relationships** between clusters.

Representative cluster reviews revealed **themes and sentiments** in author behaviors.
